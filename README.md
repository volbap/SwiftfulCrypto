An iOS app that displays cryptocurrency data fetched from CoinGecko's API.

This app was developed following the [Swiftful Thinking's SwiftUI Crypto App course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYKL6CfbSs&list=PLwvDm4Vfkdphbc3bgy_LpLRQ9DDfFGcFu). 

It uses the MVVM architecture pattern, Combine (publishers/subscribers) and CoreData for persistance.
